# Still WIP

# Kebacoin-casino
It's a project for my uni class. 
The general rule was that it needed to be a project using the Spring framework, and either SpringController or RestController.
I used REST in this project, but the requests are not stateless, because I need to check if the player doesnt want to cheat.

I implemented three basic games from casinos: roulette, slot machine and blackjack. These not include any advanced logic, just basic Collection shuffles, and the game logic itself.

### I'm not using this software to earn any money in any form and the software uses a made up currency kebacoin.

For running the application

```batch
gradlew bootRun
```

## Roulette
